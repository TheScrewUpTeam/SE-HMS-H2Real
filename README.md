# H2Real – Realistic Hydrogen for Space Engineers 🚀

> ⚠️ **Requires [Heat Management System](https://github.com/TheScrewUpTeam/SE-Heat-Management) – H2Real is an official expansion module for it.**

Hydrogen in vanilla Space Engineers is… let’s just say *a bit too magical*.  
**H2Real** fixes that with a grounded, science-based rework of how hydrogen tanks, generators, engines, and thrusters actually behave.  

---

## ✅ Core Features
- **Tank capacity equalization** – gas amounts scale properly with tank size.  
- **O2/H2 Generator realism** – production rates and power consumption rebalanced based on real electrolysis math.  
- **Hydrogen Engines** – realistic fuel-to-power ratios, heat buildup, and O₂ consumption.  
- **Hydrogen Thrusters** – adjusted thrust and fuel use to match real exhaust physics.  
- **O₂ requirement** – both engines *and* thrusters now need oxygen to run.  
- **Overheating consequences** – push your tech too far and face the fallout:  
  - Thrusters explode their emitter at 500 °C (20% grid damage, thruster disabled).  
  - Engines fail at 300 °C (still nearly double real combustion engines).  

Fully multiplayer tested and **server compatible** ✅

## ⚠️ Warning – This Mod Isn’t for Everyone
H2Real is designed for **experienced players** who want a true engineering challenge.  
If you install this mod, be prepared to:  
- ⚡ **Suffer** through enormous O2/H2 generator power demand.  
- 🚫 **Forget about mobile refueling stations** – no more carrying an entire hydrogen plant on a rover or small ship.  
- 🏭 **Build stationary production facilities** and stockpile fuel before attempting serious missions.  
- 🌍 **Struggle against gravity** – a single-stage launch won’t cut it anymore. Learn why most real rockets use staged launches… and start designing your own.  

If you’re looking for casual plug-and-play hydrogen, this mod is **not for you**.  
If you want to feel the pain – and satisfaction – of real rocketry, welcome aboard. 🚀
